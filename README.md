# Apex Hub

ApexHub is a student-centric platform that serves as a comprehensive online hub for student interactions. The platform offers two main modules: **ashop** and **acs**, catering to different aspects of student life.

## ACS Module

In the **acs** module, both academic institutions (**ACS**) and external entities can post job opportunities for students. Students have the ability to browse and apply for these jobs directly through the platform. Furthermore, external entities and academic institutions can view the job applications and update their status, providing a streamlined and efficient process for job recruitment within the student community.

## AShop Module

The **ashop** module focuses on facilitating student-to-student commerce. Students can buy and sell products within the platform, creating a marketplace exclusively for the student community. Additionally, they can rate and comment on products, fostering a transparent and reliable environment for transactions.

## Mission

ApexHub aims to empower students by providing them with a centralized platform to explore job opportunities, engage in commerce, and foster a strong sense of community. With its user-friendly interface and diverse user types including academic institutions, external entities, and students, ApexHub creates a dynamic environment for students to connect, collaborate, and thrive in their academic and professional journeys.

## Motto

**"Connecting Students, Empowering Dreams: ApexHub."**
